Rudd, M.D., J.D., is the only full-time mediator in Southern California with 20 years of clinical medical experience and two decades of experience as a trial attorney.</strong></font><br />
                  <br />
                  <font face="Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif" size="2">Dr. Rudd obtained his medical degree in 1976 from the prestigious University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. He completed the Emergency Medicine Residency program at UCLA in 1981, staying on as a member of the clinical faculty until leaving to attend Harvard Law School in 1987. During his 3 years at Harvard he continued to work as a board certified Emergency Medicine physician in the Boston area at a number of the hospitals in the Harvard Medical School teaching system. After graduating from Harvard in 1990, while maintaining a busy litigation practice, he continued to practice emergency medicine in Southern California on a part-time basis until 1997.<br />
                  <br />
                  During his legal career he has earned an AV Preeminent rating from Martindale-Hubbell and has been named a Southern California Super Lawyer for the past 2 years (2009 and 2010). In 2007 he attended the course Mediating the Litigated Case at Pepperdine University’s Strauss Institute for Dispute Resolution. Since that time he has been a member of the Los Angeles County Superior Court’s pro bono mediation panel and mediated over 3 dozen cases.<br />
                  <br />
                  Dr. Rudd sees mediation as the culmination of a long active professional career. It joins together his experience and knowledge of medicine, which, as an emergency physician ranged from obstetrics, pediatrics, geriatrics and all aspects in between, with his experience evaluating legal claims and litigating those cases he believed had merit. His goal as a mediator is the same as it was as a physician or a trial attorney, to reach the best possible result for those persons involved. He welcomes the opportunity to assist you in resolving your disputes, be they prior to litigation or being actively litigated.</font></div></td>
